UPDATE PROGRESS

Your job is to update the progress report for {props.projectName}.

## CRITICAL: This is a READ-ONLY assessment step

Do NOT run build commands, test commands, or compilation. Those are expensive and handled by dedicated test/build steps. You only read code, git history, and existing output files.

## Steps

1. Read the current progress file at {props.progressFile} (create if it doesn't exist)
2. Read git log for recent commits: `git log --oneline -50`
3. Read existing output from pipeline steps if available
4. Browse the codebase to assess current state
5. Update {props.progressFile} with:
   - Updated completion percentages per category
   - Summary of recent work (from completed tickets and git log)
   - Current gaps and priorities
   - Updated timestamp

{props.completedTickets && props.completedTickets.length > 0 ? `\nRecently completed tickets:\n${props.completedTickets.map(t => `- ${t}`).join('\n')}` : ''}

## Commit

After updating:
```
git add {props.progressFile}
git commit -m "{props.commitMessage || '📝 docs: update progress report'}"
git pull --rebase origin main && git push
```
